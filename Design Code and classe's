interface spi_if; // interface provides a standardized way to define the signals and their characteristics for communication between modules.
a module represents a self-contained unit of hardware with its own internal logic and behavior, 
while an interface defines a set of signals and properties that facilitate communication between modules or entities.
Modules contain both the interface (input/output ports) and the internal logic,
whereas interfaces are focused on specifying the communication protocol and characteristics of the signals used for inter-module communication.

  done is the name of the event. indicate the completion of a certain task or operation.
  By using events, you can create synchronization points in your code, ensuring that different processes or tasks coordinate their actions appropriately.
  Events are commonly used in hardware verification and design environments to synchronize the behavior of different modules or components.
  This is an event that is triggered when the generator has completed generating transactions.

      It helps identify the source or origin of the displayed information.

  virtual spi_if vif declares a variable named vif of type spi_if, where spi_if is the interface type. By specifying spi_if after virtual,
  you are explicitly indicating the type of the interface that vif will be bound to. If you were to write just virtual vif without specifying the interface type,
  it would be a syntax error because the type of the interface is missing.

// Overall, the run() task repeatedly retrieves a transaction object from the mailbox, transfers the data from the transaction to the interface,
stores the data in another mailbox, waits for a condition to be true, displays a message, 
and triggers an event before repeating the process again. It represents a continuous operation of data transfer between components.
